🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended, but CPU also supported)
Webcam or video files for testing

Installation

Clone the repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/anothers17/smart-recycling-detection.git
cd smart-recycling-detection

Create virtual environment
bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies
bash pip install -r requirements.txt

Add your trained model
bash# Copy your trained YOLOv8 model to the models directory
cp path/to/your/best.pt src/resources/models/

Run the application
bashpython src/main.py


📖 Usage
GUI Mode (Default)

Launch the application
bashpython src/main.py

Load your model

Click "Browse Model" and select your trained .pt file
Or drag and drop the model file onto the interface


Select video source

Click "Browse Video" for video files
Or use webcam (camera index 0)


Start detection

Click "Start Detection"
Watch real-time counting and statistics
Use "Pause", "Stop", or "Reset" as needed


Adjust settings

Use the Settings tab to adjust confidence threshold
Modify counting line position
Toggle display options



Command Line Mode
bash# Process video file without GUI
python src/main.py --no-gui --model models/best.pt --video test_video.mp4

# Enable debug logging
python src/main.py --debug

# Use specific model and video
python src/main.py --model path/to/model.pt --video path/to/video.mp4
Batch Processing
pythonfrom src.core.video_processor import process_video_file

# Process video programmatically
results = process_video_file(
    video_path="input_video.mp4",
    model_path="models/best.pt", 
    output_path="output_video.mp4"
)

🐛 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Model Loading Fails
bash# Check model file format and path
python -c "from ultralytics import YOLO; YOLO('path/to/model.pt')"
CUDA Out of Memory
bash# Reduce input size or use CPU
export DETECTION_DEVICE=cpu
export DETECTION_INPUT_SIZE=320
GUI Not Displaying
bash# Check PyQt5 installation
python -c "from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication; print('PyQt5 OK')"
Low FPS Performance
bash# Enable GPU acceleration
export DETECTION_DEVICE=cuda

# Or reduce input size
export DETECTION_INPUT_SIZE=320
